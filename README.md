This is a simple frontend app that I created to cement my concepts of React while learning it at school. 

It's modeled after some of the popular "dress-up" Flash games of the early 2000's. The basic functionality of the app is being able to click on different hats to dress my cat up in them. 

All of the photos are imported and styled with CSS.
